# MDX

With Nextra, all your `.md` and `.mdx` files under the pages directory will be
rendered with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/about), it's an advanced Markdown format
with React component support.

You can use import and use React components inside your Markdown files like
this:

```mdx filename="example.mdx"
import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

**Markdown With React Components**

<Callout emoji="✅">
  **MDX** (the library), at its core, transforms MDX (the syntax) to JSX. It receives an MDX string
  and outputs a _JSX string_. It does this by parsing the MDX document to a syntax tree and then
  generates a JSX document from that tree.
</Callout>
```

Generates:

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<div className="p-4 border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-900 rounded mt-6">

## Syntax Highlighting

Automatic syntax highlighting

````mdx
```js
console.log('hello, world')
```
````

Renders:

```js
console.log('hello, world')
```

You can also add the `{line|range}` modifier to highlight specific lines:

````mdx
```jsx {4,6-8}
import useSWR from 'swr'

function Profile() {
  const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/user', fetcher)

  if (error) return <div>failed to load</div>
  if (!data) return <div>loading...</div>
  return <div>hello {data.name}!</div>
}
```
````

```jsx {4,6-8}
import useSWR from 'swr'

function Profile() {
  const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/user', fetcher)

  if (error) return <div>failed to load</div>
  if (!data) return <div>loading...</div>
  return <div>hello {data.name}!</div>
}
```

## Inline Code

You can use \`content\` to wrap inline code content like: `let x = 1`.

## Blockquote

> Where some people measure progress in answers-right per test or tests-passed
> per year, we are more interested in Sistine-Chapel-Ceilings per Lifetime.
>
> — Alan Kay, A Personal Computer for Children of All Ages

```

Renders:

<Callout>Give [**Nextra**](https://github.com/shuding/nextra) a star!</Callout>
