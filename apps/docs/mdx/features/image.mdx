# Next.js Image

You can use
[Next.js Image](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization)
directly in MDX.

If the `demo.png` file is located at `/public/demo.png`, you can use the code
below to display it:

```mdx
import Image from 'next/image'

<Image src="/demo.png" alt="Hello" width={500} height={500} />
```

## Static Image

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="warning">
  You need to opt-in to this feature by enabling [`staticImage:
  true`](/get-started#create-manually).
</Callout>

Nextra also supports automatic static image imports, you no longer need to
specify the width and height of the image manually, and you can directly use the
Markdown syntax to display the same image:

```md
![Hello](/demo.png)
```

With Next.js Image, there will be no layout shift, and a beautiful blury
placeholder will be shown by default when loading the images:

![Nextra](../../app/opengraph-image.png)
