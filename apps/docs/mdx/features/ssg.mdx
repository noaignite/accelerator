# Next.js SSG

With Next.js, you can pre-render your page using
[Static Generation (SSG)](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended).
Your pages will be generated at build time and statically served to visitors. It
can also be cached by a CDN to maximize the performance.

This is supported by Nextra too. Here's an example:

export async function Stars() {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.github.com/repos/shuding/nextra`)
  const repo = await response.json()
  const stars = repo.stargazers_count || 0
  return <b>{stars}</b>
}

> Nextra has <Stars /> stars on GitHub!

The number above was generated at build time via MDX server components. With
[Incremental Static Regeneration](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#incremental-static-regeneration)
enabled, it will be kept up to date.

Here's the MDX code for the example above:

```js filename="ssg.mdx"
export async function Stars() {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.github.com/repos/shuding/nextra`)
  const repo = await response.json()
  const stars = repo.stargazers_count || 0
  return <b>{stars}</b>
}

> Nextra has <Stars /> stars on GitHub!
```
