### `omit`

The `omit` function creates a new object by omitting specified keys from the
original object. It takes an object and an array of keys to exclude,
returning a new object that contains only the properties not specified in
the keys array. This is useful for filtering out sensitive or unnecessary
information from an object before using it.

- @param `object` - The original object from which keys will be omitted.
- @param `keys` - An array of keys (property names) to omit from the original
  object.
- @returns A new object that contains all properties of `object` except for
  those specified in the `keys` array.

#### Example

```ts
omit({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }, ['a', 'c']) // { b: 2 }
```
