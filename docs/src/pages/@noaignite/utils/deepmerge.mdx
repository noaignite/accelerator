### `deepmerge`

The `deepmerge` function recursively merges two objects, combining their
properties and deeply merging nested objects. It can optionally clone
objects during the merge to avoid mutating the original input. This is
useful when merging configuration objects, state trees, or any deeply
nested structures.

- @param `target` - The target object that will receive properties from the
  source object.
- @param `source` - The source object from which properties will be copied and
  merged into the target.
- @param `options` [object Object],[object Object],[object Object]
- @returns The merged object, which is a combination of properties from both
  the target and source objects.

#### Example

```ts
deepmerge({ a: 1 }, { b: 2 }) // { a: 1, b: 2 }
```
