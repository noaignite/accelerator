### `pick`

The `pick` function creates a new object by selecting specified keys from
the original object. It takes an object and an array of keys to include,
returning a new object that contains only the properties specified in the
keys array. This is useful for extracting relevant data from an object while
ignoring other properties.

- @param `object` - The original object from which keys will be selected.
- @param `keys` - An array of keys (property names) to include in the new object.
- @returns A new object that contains only the properties of `object` specified
  in the `keys` array.

#### Example

```ts
pick({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }, ['a', 'c']) // { a: 1, c: 3 }
```
