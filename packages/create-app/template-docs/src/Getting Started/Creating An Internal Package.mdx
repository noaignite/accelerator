# Creating An Internal Package

Internal packages are [packages](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/handbook/sharing-code) which are only intended to be used inside your monorepo. They're extremely useful for sharing code between apps in closed-source monorepos.

Internal packages are quick to create, and can be turned into [external packages](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/handbook/publishing-packages) if you end up wanting to publish them to npm.

Read more about how to create an internal package at the [Turborepo docs](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/handbook/sharing-code/internal-packages).
